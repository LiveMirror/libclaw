CLAW LIBRARY: INSTALLATION NOTES

SUMMARY:
 1. INSTALL
 2. UNINSTALL
 3. OPTIONS


-- 1. INSTALL --

You need cmake to install this library and also Boost 1.42. Maybe libjpeg 6b and
libpng 1.2.8 too.
These two libraries are required by default but can be disabled (see the OPTIONS
below).

Be sure to NOT turn off the use of libjpeg or libpng if they are required by the
program you compile libclaw for. If you have a doubt, I recommend to keep the
default settings.

If you want html documentation, be sure you have "doxygen" installed.

Go in the libclaw-<version> directory.

For the full installation, type :
    cmake . -DOPTION1 -DOPTION2 ...
    make
    make install # as root

See below to know what 'OPTION' can be.

-- 2. UNINSTALL --

To remove the files you've installed, just type
    make uninstall # as root


-- 3. OPTIONS --

You can customize your installation with the following options.

  CLAW_NO_JPEG={true|false}
        Deactivate or activate jpeg support (default is false)

  CLAW_NO_PNG={true|false}
        Deactivate or activate png support (default is false)

  CLAW_INSTALL_CMAKE_MODULES={true|false}
        Activate or deactivate the installation of the CMake modules for Claw
        (default is true)

  CLAW_CMAKE_MODULES_INSTALL_PATH=<dir>
        Allow you to select the directory in which the CMake modules of Claw
        will be installed (useful if you define a special installation prefix).

these are cmake options:

  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<dir>
        Directory in which the files will be installed (default is /usr/local)

  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE={debug|release|profile}
        Activate or deactivate code debugging/profiling

where :
  {a|b} means either 'a' or 'b'
  <dir> is a path to a directory.
